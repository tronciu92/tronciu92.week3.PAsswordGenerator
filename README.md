# JavaScript Homework: Password Generator

This project solves the security concern of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.

Page Layout Page includes a text area where the generated password will be written as well as a button, which when clicked, will copy the password to the user's clipboard.

The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.

The criteria that the password is able to meet are:

1.the password is between 8 - 128 characters long, 

2.the password must have at least one of the following character types:
  #### lowercase characters
  #### uppercasse characters
  #### special characters
  #### numeric characters

Once the program has verified that the password length meets the minimum and maximum requirements, it then determines which criteria the user has selected and generates a secure password string based on the user's input. The new password is then displayed in the text area.

Once the user has generated a new password, there is a secondary function that allows the user to copy the newly generated password to their clipboard, in order to copy and paste it into another application, such as a text editor or web browser.
